/** 
 The first input array is the key to the correct answers to an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one contains a student's submitted answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer, represented as an empty string (in C the space character is used).

//Parameters - 2 arrays will be given. Each array index will only have 1 character strings.
